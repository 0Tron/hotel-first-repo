there are 4 commands I want you to know.  Write these down. Put them on a sticky note on or next your computer -these are commands you will use for the rest of your development career. 

$ = its a terminal; dont need to type it in

 - $ git status
    - this is an informational command.  Use it frequently to see where you are in the process.
   - discuss the status message 
   - branch name
   - shows what I have locally that differs from what's on remote.  These are my changes.

- $ git add filename ("github-intro.md" - don't need quotes)
   - this takes these all the files which have been changed and puts them in a staging area.  

- $ git commit -m "initial commit"
    - convention is that the first commit to any repo have the message read 'initial commit'.  After this, you will want to write a message that makes it clear what modifications were made.  Git commit adds id.

- $ git push origin filename 

- go back to github and see the file is there.

To see the branch you are currently using: $ git branch
To see what files have been modified: $ git status
To see the directory you are currently using: $ pwd
To see what files are located in the current directory/repository: $ ls

Hello hotel - its almost lunch time!
